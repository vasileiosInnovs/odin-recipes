            Cocktail meatballs are a classic appetizer combining juicy, bite-sized meatballs with flavorful sauce—the perfect party snack. Made from a mix of ground beef, pork, or turkey, these meatballs are seasoned with herbs, breadcrumbs, and spices for a savory taste and tender texture. They simmer in various sauces, from tangy cocktail sauce to sweet and sour glaze or rich BBQ sauce, making them irresistibly delicious. Served on toothpicks or small skewers, they're easy to grab and enjoy in one bite.

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, garlic, onion, salt and pepper. Mix until well combined. Form the mixture into 1-inch meatballs and place them on a baking sheet or tray.</li>
        <li>Heat a bit of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the meatballs in batches until browned on all sides and cooked through (about 8-10 minutes). Alternatively, bake them at 375°F (190°C) for 15-20 minutes, until cooked through.</li>
        <li>While the meatballs are cooking, combine the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, honey, mustard, garlic powder and onion powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Let it cook for 5-7 minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Once the meatballs are cooked, transfer them to the sauce and stir gently to coat them evenly. Let them simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes to absorb the flavors</li>
        <li>Arrange the meatballs on a serving dish or platter, and serve with toothpicks or skewers.</li>
    </ol>
