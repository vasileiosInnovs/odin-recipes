        <p>
            Baked pasta is a comforting, hearty dish that combines pasta, rich sauce, and melted cheese—all baked together into a flavorful, satisfying meal. It starts with cooked pasta like penne, ziti, or rigatoni, mixed with either tomato-based marinara, creamy béchamel, or meat sauce. The pasta-sauce mixture is then topped with copious amounts of cheese—mozzarella, Parmesan, or ricotta—and baked until golden and bubbly. The result is a deliciously melted, flavorful casserole perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying as a cozy family meal.

            This versatile dish welcomes customization with ground meat, vegetables, herbs, and spices to suit your taste. As a bonus, it's an excellent make-ahead option since the flavors develop and improve after a few hours or overnight. Whether served as a main course or part of a larger spread, baked pasta remains a crowd-pleasing favorite that brings comfort and warmth to any table.

        <li>1 1/2 cups marinara sauce (or any pasta sauce of your choice)</li>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage (optional, for a meat sauce)</li>
        <li> 1 small onion, finely chopped (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for a spicy kick)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese, if preferred)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li> 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Boil the pasta in salted water according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat a little oil over medium heat. Add the ground beef or sausage and cook until browned. Add the chopped onion and garlic and cook until softened. Stir in the marinara sauce, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, egg, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a large baking dish (9x13 inches), layer the cooked pasta, followed by the meat sauce, and then spoon the ricotta mixture over the top. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese evenly over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for about 20 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the top is golden.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
