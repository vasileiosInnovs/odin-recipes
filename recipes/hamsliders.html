            Baked ham and cheese sliders are delicious, easy-to-make appetizers that combine ham, melted cheese, and a buttery, sweet glaze on soft mini sandwich rolls. Made with sliced ham and Swiss or cheddar cheese layered between dinner rolls, these sliders are baked until perfect. A flavorful butter-mustard sauce creates a golden, crispy top that complements the warm, melted cheese and tender ham—making every bite irresistible.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 slider buns (small dinner rolls, Hawaiian rolls or similar)</li>
        <li> 1 lb (450g) sliced deli ham (or more depending on preference)</li>
        <li>10 slices Swiss cheese (or cheddar cheese, if preferred)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter (melted)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Dijon mustard (or yellow mustard)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp honey (optional, for sweetness)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp poppy seeds (optional, for topping)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C)</li>
        <li>Slice the buns in half, keeping the top and bottom connected. Arrange the bottom halves of the buns in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer the sliced ham evenly over the bottom halves of the buns. Place one slice of cheese on top of the ham for each slider. Top with the other half of the buns.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, Dijon mustard, honey (if using), Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the butter mixture evenly over the top of the assembled sliders. Use a brush or spoon to coat them thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the poppy seeds over the top of the buns for added texture and flavor (optional).</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the tops of the buns are golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove from the oven, cut the sliders along the bun lines, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
